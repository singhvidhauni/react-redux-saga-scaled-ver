# React Redux CRUD Demo with Async Actions and Routing

Welcome to the React Redux CRUD Demo repository! This project provides a comprehensive demonstration of a React web application that incorporates CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations using Redux for state management. Additionally, it features Redux Saga for handling asynchronous actions and react-router-dom for seamless route-based navigation.

## Key Features:

### React Components: 
Explore a well-organized React component structure, showcasing the creation of user interfaces for efficient interaction.

### Redux State Management with Saga:

Witness the power of Redux and Redux Saga in managing the application's state, enabling both synchronous and asynchronous state changes.

### CRUD Operations:

Experience how the application seamlessly performs CRUD operations, interacting with a JSON-based server API to create, read, update, and delete data.

### REST ful API Integration:

Gain insights into how the app communicates with the server using RESTful API endpoints, reflecting best practices for web development.

### Route-Based Navigation:

Implement smooth navigation through different sections of the application using react-router-dom.

## Getting Started:

### Clone the Repository:

Start by cloning this repository to your local machine using the following command:

```
git clone https://github.com/singhvidhauni/react-redux-saga-middleware.git
> cd react-redux-emp-mgmt
> cd client
```
Install Dependencies: Navigate to the client directory and install the required dependencies:

```
client> npm start
```

To run the json-server based API server. 
```
> cd react-redux-emp-mgmt
> cd api
> npm install dependencies
  api > npm start
```
### Technologies Used:

- React
- Redux with Redux Saga (for asynchronous actions)
- react-router-dom (for route-based navigation)
- JSON Server (for the server API)
  Feel free to use this repository as a reference or starting point for your own projects involving React, Redux, Redux Saga, react-router-dom, and RESTful APIs. Happy coding!
